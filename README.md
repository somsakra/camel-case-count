# CamelCase Count

Alice wrote a sequence of words in [CamelCase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camel_case) as a string of letters, _**s**_, having the following properties:

- It is a concatenation of one or more _words_ consisting of English letters.
- All letters in the first word are _lowercase_.
- For each of the subsequent words, the first letter is _uppercase_ and rest of the letters are _lowercase_.

Given _**s**_, print the number of words in _**s**_, on a new line.

### **Input Format**

A single line containing string _**s**_.

### **Constraints**

- 1 ≤ |_**s**_| ≤ 10<sup>5</sup>

### **Output Format**

Print the number of words in string _**s**_.

### **Sample Input**

```
saveChangesInTheEditor
```

### **Sample Output**

```
5
```

### **Explanation**

String _**s**_ contains five words:

1. save
2. Changes
3. In
4. The
5. Editor

Thus, we print 5 on new line.
